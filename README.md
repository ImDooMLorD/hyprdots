# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, forked from [mylinuxforwork/dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) and customized to fit my workflow. These configurations enhance my terminal experience by optimizing Neovim, Kitty, Fish shell, Tmux, and Waybar to work seamlessly together.

## Prerequisite

Before using my dotfiles, make sure to first check out and set up [mylinuxforwork/dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles), as my configuration builds upon it.
